                <div class="col xl">
                    <p>This is generally most popular and recomended because it gives you the best balance of attack speed, life steal, ease of use, while maintaining a high enough crit chance to be consistant. It also tends to be easiest to carry your games as without crit you can sometimes find yourself leaning heavily on your team mates always doing their jobs, which as we all know, doesnt always happen.</p>

                    <p>This build is best for shredding tanks and easier to hit attack speed cap, while also being far more consistant than relying on crit RNG. you'll usually pivot to this build when tank heavy metas are more common.</p>

                <div class="col xl">
                    <p>This build is almost always the most possible total DPS you can get but also usually only uses 1 or 2 crit items. While this is excellent for competitive scenarios, i generally avoid this as luck plays a major factor in 1v1s around the map, as well as team fights, where you can get very unlucky and lose games because of it.</p>

                <div class="col xl">
                    <p>This is a very specialized build path not seeing much use as an ADC very often. Its more of a high skill high reward type of playstyle with glaring downsides where it struggles. i wouldnt generally recommend this style of play unless you plan on pretty much exclusivly diving back line and blowing people up very quickly. </p>
