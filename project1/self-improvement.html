                <p>BE SELF CRITICAL. Assume that you are not perfect, and that you may be doing many things wrong. Dont let rough game get in the way of your own self growth. Try to focus on your own mistakes and fix them the best that you can.</p>

            <div class="col xl">
                <p>Do not blame anyone for anything except for yourself, at least in the beginning. Focus solely on you until you have a much deeper understanding of the game and what your job/role intales. Mute other players if they cause you grief, just grind your own mechanical skill and awareness doint the best that you can in any given game.</p>

            <div class="col xl">
                <p>Save your own gameplay and watch it back. Watch other content creators or pros playing the game to further advance your own skill set. I can not express how important this is, it can also be hard to see yourself underperforming. do not let that stop you, stay out of your own head and keep persuing to be the best player that you can be, and I promise you that you'll see dramatic improvements.</p>
