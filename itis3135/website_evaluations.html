            <h3><a href="http://theroommovie.com/">The Room Movie Website</a></h3>
            <p>This is a website showing off a movie called "The Room". It is not impressive visually and it is no surprise that it does not follow the CRAP design principles.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contrast - There is not good contrast between the items in the nav menu (which are red) and the background. Some users may find this hard if not impossible to read.</li>
                <li>Repetition - Nothing on this page looks uniform, it creates a feeling that the company responsible is not very professional.</li>
                <li>Alignment - This page is not well aligned at all. It feels like the different elements on the page have no structure whatsoever.</li>
                <li>Proximity - The various elements on the page are so close to one another. It is hard to tell where one element ends and the other starts.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3><a href="https://www.charlotte.edu/">UNC Charlotte Website</a></h3>
            <p>The Charlotte Website does a great job at utilizing CRAP design principles. The aesthetics of the site are good, nothing seems out of place, and they did a good job at making the right things pop out at you.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contrast - There is a lot of good contrast on this page. Nothing is hard to read because it is too similar to the background</li>
                <li>Repetition - There is just the right amount of repitition. Elements that look alike provide similar functionality.</li>
                <li>Alignment -  The alignment on Charlotte's webpage is good, everything that should be together is and elements that are vastly different are separated.</li>
                <li>Proximity - All related elements are close to each other while being spaced properly for minimal confusion.</li>
            </ul>
