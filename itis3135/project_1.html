            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
            <h4>Describe your application and its purpose</h4>
            <p>This application is a site I am building for a friend that wants to promote his coaching for the game Smite. It will give him a way for people to reach out to him about coaching plans.</p>
            <h4>Intended Users of the website</h4>
            <p>The intended users of the website would be gamers who play Smite that want to take their game to the next level with a coach.</p>
            <h4>Overview of the content of the website</h4>
            <p>The overview of the content on this site will be broken into 5 pages. A home page that talks about the game and why coaching is helpful for improving in Smite. A “Contact Me” page that will have his contact information for WhatsApp, Discord, and an email address he can be reached through. The third page will consist of plans, pricing, and session info. Page four will be recommended builds, specific to the game of Smite, so gamers can get an idea of what they should be using during their games. Finally, the fifth page will be a guide to self-improvement with basic tips on how to take your Smite gameplay to the next level.</p>
